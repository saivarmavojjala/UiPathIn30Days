Public Web shop
For selling furniture online
Executive Summary
This is a re-engineering project that we did for the client. The core business logic was taken from the
existing system and then all redundant functionalities were removed and the entire application was re-
written in ColdFusion.
Actually early-on client had started this project with an in-house developer but after few months into the
build they figured out that it was an immature written code not good enough for making live. That is client
got in touch with us. We set up a two developer team with a shared QA resource for testing, directly
reporting to the project manager of the Client.
Since client had already spent time in building it in-house, time left for go to live was very less.
It took our team 2 months to recode from scratch all basic function of public website and a basic site
administrator and got it live on time with good quality.
The client was also having multiple public facing websites of his furniture shop with different branding
needs. The first website is designed such that, all the site look and feel {including header, footer, css,
images) the same and product catalogue is dynamically customizable to rebrand quickly and release as a
new website.
Once that first web site for the client was launched, the focus changed to creating replicas of the same,
using the core content driven architecture and two more websites are made live within a span of a week.
